## üöÄ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **data science workflow** applied to a real-world scientific challenge: estimating Jupiter‚Äôs mass using astrophysical image data and **Kepler‚Äôs Third Law**. From raw data collection in extreme conditions to mathematical modeling and uncertainty quantification, this work reflects the end-to-end analytical process typical in applied data science.

Key tasks included:
- **Astrophotography data acquisition** using DSLR+telescope setup
- **Signal extraction** through noise reduction, source detection, and image cropping
- **Time-series modeling** of orbital motion from image-derived coordinates
- **Model fitting** with `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` to extract orbital parameters
- **Physical inference** using laws of planetary motion
- **Uncertainty propagation** for rigorous error estimation

All computations were done in Python using tools like `numpy`, `scipy`, `photutils`, `rawpy`, and `matplotlib`.
